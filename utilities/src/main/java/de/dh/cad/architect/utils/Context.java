/**
 * Wrapper class to hold a context containing a single value.
 * This can be used to trick the Java compiler in case a final variable is necessary.
 * Typically this is used to hold an artificial context during multiple calls to a lambda or anonymous class' method.
 *
 * For example:
 * <code><pre>
 * Context<Boolean> changed = new Context(false);
 *
 * mMyObjects.forEach(o -> {
 *     if (o.someMethod()) {
 *         changed.set(true);
 *     }
 * });
 *
 * if (changed.get()) {
 *     // ...
 * }
