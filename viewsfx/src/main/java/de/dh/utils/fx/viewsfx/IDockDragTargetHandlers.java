 * else they should call {@link DockDragOperation#removeDockFeedback()}.
 * Handler method {@link #handleDragExited(DockDragOperation)} should call {@link DockDragOperation#removeDockFeedback()} (and clean up possible local dock feedback resources).

 * {@link #handleDragDropped(DockDragOperation, double, double)} doesn't need to remove the dragging feedback because method
 * {@link #handleDragExited(DockDragOperation)} will also be called in case of a drop.
