/**

 * to be able to decide how to store the data format independent. This way, we move the job of interpreting the raw {@code .mtl} text
 * lines to the point where the concrete 3D object material settings are configured.
 * This is bad because the model is completely fixed to the capabilities of the material file specification,
 * but it allows us a direct transformation from material file commands to the 3D objects (e.g. JavaFX).
