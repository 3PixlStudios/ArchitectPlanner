/**
 * Data of a 3D object, contains a collection of meshes which are mapped to materials, as it was defined in an {@code .obj} file.
 * The {@link ObjData} class provides an intermediate, in-memory format for the object definition which allows us
 * to override the specified mesh materials via user configuration, for example redefine the materials of the meshes of a piece of furniture.
 * This would not be possible so easily if we would translate the object data directly to objects in the final 3D library format
 * (e.g. {@link Shape3D} with {@link Material} instances).
 * We use a separate map {@link #getMeshIdsToMaterials()} to indirectly assign mesh objects to materials via the artificial mesh id
 * (instead of using the material name from the {@link MeshData} for mapping). This allows us to exchange the material of each individual
 * mesh instead of just exchanging a material which is potentially mapped to multiple meshes. Depending on the input data, each concept
 * has its pros and cons; we use the more flexible concept (mapping of materials via mesh ids).
 * Note that this model requires the {@link MeshData#getId() mesh id} to be stable among different readings of the same object
 * if we want to use the described overriding mechanism:
 * Typically, the material assignment (mesh ids -> material) is persisted between different sessions while the object data is loaded repeatedly
 * from the same file. In that usage scenario, the mesh id is used as stable connection between the object file mesh objects and the
 * assigned materials.
